In this chapter, we will focus on what to expect during the interview process. The interview process can vary depending on the organization and position, but there are several common steps that candidates can expect.

Initial Screening
-----------------

The initial screening is often conducted by a recruiter or hiring manager and typically involves a phone or video interview. The purpose of the initial screening is to assess the candidate's qualifications and interest in the position.

In-Person Interviews
--------------------

In-person interviews are typically conducted after the initial screening and may involve one or multiple rounds of interviews. Candidates should expect to answer a range of questions related to their qualifications, experience, and fit for the organization. They may also be asked to complete skills assessments or provide work samples.

Background Checks
-----------------

Background checks are typically conducted at the later stages of the interview process and may include criminal record checks, employment verification, and reference checks. Candidates should ensure that the information provided on their resume and during the interview process is accurate and truthful.

Job Offers
----------

Job offers are typically extended after the final round of interviews and background checks have been completed. Candidates should carefully review the job offer and negotiate salary and benefits as needed. Once a job offer has been accepted, candidates should provide timely notice to their current employer and begin preparing for their new role.
