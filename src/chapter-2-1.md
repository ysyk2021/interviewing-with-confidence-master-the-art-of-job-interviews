Video interviews can be conducted through software such as Skype or Zoom and can be used in place of an in-person interview. They allow employers to assess a candidate's communication skills, professionalism, and overall fit for the organization.

Panel Interviews

Panel interviews involve multiple interviewers who ask questions and evaluate a candidate's responses. They may consist of managers, team members, or other stakeholders in the organization. Panel interviews can be intimidating, but they provide a more comprehensive assessment of a candidate's suitability for the position and organizational culture.

Behavioral Interviews

Group interviews involve multiple candidates being interviewed at the same time. They can be used to assess teamwork and collaboration skills, as well as individual qualifications. Group interviews can be challenging, but candidates should focus on being engaged, contributing to discussions, and showcasing their strengths.
