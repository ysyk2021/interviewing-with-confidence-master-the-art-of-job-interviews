Strategies for Answering Difficult Interview Questions
------------------------------------------------------

When faced with a difficult or unexpected interview question, consider the following strategies:

1. Take a moment to think: It's okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts before responding to a difficult question. Take a deep breath and compose yourself before answering.

2. Clarify the question: If the question is unclear or ambiguous, ask for clarification before responding.

3. Use the STAR method: The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) can be used to provide a structured response that showcases specific examples of past behavior in similar situations.

4. Be honest: If you don't know the answer to a question, it's better to be honest than to make something up. You can offer to follow up with more information after the interview.

5. Show your problem-solving abilities: Use the opportunity to showcase your problem-solving abilities by breaking down the question and providing a thoughtful response.

6. Avoid negativity: Even if the question is negative or critical, avoid responding with negativity towards previous employers or coworkers.

Common Difficult Interview Questions and How to Answer Them

Some common difficult interview questions and how to answer them include:

1. "What are your weaknesses?": Rather than highlighting a weakness, focus on an area for growth and explain what you're doing to improve. For example, "I'm currently working on improving my public speaking skills by taking a course on effective communication."

2. "Why should we hire you over other candidates?": Focus on your unique strengths and experiences that make you stand out from other candidates. Provide specific examples of past accomplishments that demonstrate your value.

3. "Tell me about a time you failed and how you handled it.": Use the STAR method to provide a structured response that showcases how you identified and learned from your failure, and what actions you took to improve in the future.
